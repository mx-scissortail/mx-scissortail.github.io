<h1>Hello,</h1>

I'm Ellie. I have an educational background and experience with programming, UI & UX design, pure and applied mathematics, cognitive science, AI/ML, philosophy of science, language and mind, physics (esp. foundations of QM and GR) and game design.<br><br>
Unfortunately most of the stuff I've worked on can't be made public or is published under an old name, but if you're curious, you can check out my <a href="https://medium.com/@skylernelson_64801/state-architecture-patterns-in-react-a-review-df02c1e193c6">three-part series of articles on performant React application architecture</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mx-scissortail/">my github profile</a> (which mostly contains generic Javascript stuff, old projects and silly jokes).<br><br>
Lately I've been working on language and compiler design, a statistical simulation tool for game designers, various game ideas in C# (Unity), teaching myself Rust and learning about how modern C++ has changed since I last used it.<br><br>
One of my hobbies is playing, running and designing tabletop RPGs. A while back, I wrote a pretty popular article on how to make action scenes more interesting, which was hosted on <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/making-combat-interesting">The Gauntlet blog</a>.<br><br>
I also made this very silly <a href="https://mx-scissortail.github.io/discount-npc-names/">NPC generator</a>, inspired by <a href="http://friendsatthetable.net">my favorite AP podcast</a>.<br><br>
While I'm talking about myself, one thing I'm proud of is that Jeff VanderMeer (the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EGJ32A6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1">Annihilation</a>) once <a href="https://electricliterature.com/are-we-alone/">quoted me in a speech</a>.<br><br>
Cool,<br>
Ellie
